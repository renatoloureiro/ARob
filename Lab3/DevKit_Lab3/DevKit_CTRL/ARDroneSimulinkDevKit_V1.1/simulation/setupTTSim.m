%  ARDrone Simulation Example: Trajectory Tracking 
%  =======================================================================
%  
%  The simulation is used to validate the trajectory tracking controller
%  and generation of the desired trajectory for the ARDRone before flight 
%  testing. Control and guidance blocks are
%  exactly the same for both simulation and real-time Wi-Fi control.
